If you lose the password, or it does not display as shown above, or you need to restart the Jenkins
sever, you can always retrieve the password by accessing the command line of Jenkins Docker container.
Create a second terminal window in VS Code and enter the following commands so that you do not stop the
Jenkins server:

docker exec -it jenkins_server /bin/bash
cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# taken from devasc seems to work
docker run --rm -u root -p
8080:8080 -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home -v $(which
docker):/usr/bin/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v
"$HOME":/home --name jenkins_server jenkins/jenkins:lts

just a change
