    - Create a .csv file with points of your cable run to the array. 
      Each point must be on a new line in a format x, y, z coordinates in meters.
      Firts point must be position of amps.
      For example:
      0,0,0
      0,10,0
      2,10,0
      2,10,6
      Would describe a cable run from amps at x=0, y=0 and z=0. Cable run goes 10 meters
      side of stage, until next junction, then 2 meters forward, then gets to the array 
      and goes 6 meters up in "z" plane to reach speakers.
    - Export .dbea file from ArrayCalc. Right click on your array and choose export.
    - Upload both files.
